# Database Setup Complete

The database setup files have been created and include:

1. `create_database.sql`: Creates the study_materials database with proper character encoding
2. `schema.sql`: Creates the tables (users and materials) and sets up the initial admin user
3. `database_setup.php`: PHP script to execute the SQL files and set up the database
4. `config.example.php`: Template for database configuration

To set up the database:

1. Copy `config.example.php` to `config.php` and update with your database credentials
2. Run `php database_setup.php`

The database includes:
- Users table with roles and authentication
- Materials table for storing study materials
- Foreign key relationships for data integrity
- Initial admin user (username: admin, password: admin123)
